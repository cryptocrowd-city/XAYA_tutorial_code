# Mover Unity

The code for the Mover Unity tutorial can be found in the [xayalib_unity](https://github.com/xaya/xayalib_unity) repository as it can be used as a template for those wishing to use libxayagame's `xaya::DefaultMain` to create a game. (Note that the `DefaultMain` method is concealed by `XAYAWrapper`.)

The [Mover sample game in C# with Unity tutorial is here](https://github.com/xaya/xaya_tutorials/wiki/Unity-Mover-Tutorial).
